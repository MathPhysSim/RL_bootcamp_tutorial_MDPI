# to execute this experiment run:
# python train.py experiment=example_experiment


defaults:
  - override /agent: trpo # let's change the agent config to another file


# all parameters below will be merged with parameters from default configurations set above
# this allows you to overwrite only specified parameters

# always good to have a good unique name for experiment so we can find the results in logs/ again
task_name: "example_experiment"

# since we changed the agent we may also need to change the number of training environments
num_train_envs: 2


# change some paramters in the environment config
env:

# just for demostration purposes we change parts of the config we have overridden in the default list
